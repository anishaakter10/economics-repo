             <h1><b>What is Economics?</b></h1>

             <p>Economics is a social science concerned with the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services.</p>

             <h1>Type of <span class="aqua-color">Economics</span></h1>
             <p>The study of economics is generally broken down into two categories.
        <ul>
            <li>Microeconomics focuses on how individual consumers and producers make their decisions. This includes a single person, a household, a business or a governmental organization</li>
        
            <li>Macroeconomics studies the overall economy.  This can include a distinct geographical region, a country, a continent or even the whole world. </li>
        </ul>
            </p>
            <h1 class="color-style">Production</h1>
             <p>Production is a process of combining various material inputs (things/resources) and immaterial inputs (plans, know-how) in order to make something for consumption (the output). It is the act of creating an output, a good or service which has value and contributes to meeting the needs of people in a society. 
            <p><b>Goods:</b>Goods is defined as anything produced to meet the need of individuals or groups. For example, rice, chairs, aero-planes etc.</p>
            
            <p><b>Services:</b> would be the performance of any duties or work for another; helpful or professional activity to meet the need of individuals or groups. For example, Legal advice, education from universities etc.</p>
            </p>
            <p><b><span class="color-style" id="font">Factors Of Production</span></b>
            Factors of production is a term to describe the inputs that are used in the production of goods or services.</p>
            
            <p><b>Land:</b> is the natural resource that is used to produce goods and service. Land is not just restricted to the physical property or real estate (land). It includes any natural resources the land produces, such as crude oil, coal, water, gold or natural gas. The resources are natural materials that are included in the production of goods and services.</p>
            
            <p><b>Labor:</b> is the amount of work laborers and workers perform that helps the production process. For example, if a laborer works and her efforts create a good or service, she contributes to production.</p>
            
            <p><b>Capital:</b> is any tool, building or machine used to produce goods or services. Capital varies throughout each industry. For example, a computer scientist uses a computer to create a program; his capital is the computer he uses. On the other hand, a chef uses pots and pans to deliver a good and service, so the pots and pans are the chef's capital.</p>
